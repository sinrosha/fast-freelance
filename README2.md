This project will be the boilerplate for any website project that we will work on it. There are many architectural and design decisions that will be opinionated based on some rudimentary research. This is [Next js](https://nextjs.org/) project and uses all the great features that Next js provides.

## CSS

We will be using CSS Modules along with tailwind css. This combination was decided as it was a perfect solution to the problem's we had in mind. CSS modules solves issues like global namespacing etc. Tailwind CSS helps us with it's large Utility classes. The selling point of this combo was that the generated CSS files only have CSS related to the page and the components used in it. So no loading of any extra CSS which is not used by the page.
